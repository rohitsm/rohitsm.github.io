Hi, my name is Rohit Menon and I am a senior software engineer at Rakuten Inc. in Singapore where I work on building software infrastructure and products that are used internally to support Rakuten's various advertisement business platforms and data analytics activities. More detailed and up-to-date info on what I am currently doing can be found on my LinkedIn page.

Prior to Rakuten, I was a student at Nanyang Technological University from where I received my bachelor's degree in computer science. Before that I was a student at Temasek Polytechnic from where I graduated with a diploma in electronics with merit.

On the web, I tend to use `rohitsm` as my handle of choice, whenever and wherever it is available. I occasionally blog when I can't fit things into 140 or so characters. Outside of work, whenever I code, I occasionally share them on Github.
