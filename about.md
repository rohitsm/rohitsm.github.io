Hi, my name is Rohit Menon and I am a senior software engineer at Rakuten Inc. in Singapore as part of the Global Ad-Tech Division. I work on building software infrastructure and products that are used internally to support Rakuten's various advertisement business platforms and data analytics activities. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitsm) page has more info on what I am currently upto.

Prior to Rakuten, I was a student at Nanyang Technological University from where I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Before that I was a student at Temasek Polytechnic from where I graduated with a Diploma in Electronics with Merit.

I occasionally blog when I can't fit things into 140 or so characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rohitsm). Outside of work, whenever I code, I occasionally share them on [Github](https://github.com/rohitsm).
