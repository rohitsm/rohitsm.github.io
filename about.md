Hi, my name is Rohit Menon and I am a senior software engineer at Rakuten Inc. in Singapore as part of the Global Ad-Tech Division. I work on building software infrastructure and products that are used internally to support Rakuten's various advertisement business platforms and data analytics activities. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitsm) page has more info on what I am currently doing.

Prior to Rakuten, I was a student at Nanyang Technological University from where I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Before that I was a student at Temasek Polytechnic from where I graduated with a Diploma in Electronics with Merit.

I occasionally blog when I can't fit things into 140 or so characters on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rohitsm) and I sometimes share code on [Github](https://github.com/rohitsm). Outside of work, I volunteer my time with a few organizations such as the Singapore National Library Board, the Singapore Red Cross and the Asian Civilization Museum where I help out with their various programmes and initiatives. 

I used to use Blogger for 13 years until early 2020 when I decided to move to Github. My old blog is archived at [oldblog.rohitsm.com](https://oldblog.rohitsm.com). **Fun fact:** my old blog got [featured in a documentary](https://oldblog.rohitsm.com/2014/11/humblebrag-this-blog-got-featured-in.html) about Aaron Swartz.
